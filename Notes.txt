  HTML => Hyper text Mark up Language (mark the content as text: bold italic ) 

  => tags 

  => HTML was invented by Sir Tim Berners Lee in late 1991
  => HTML is used to develop static web pages 
  => It can saved with ".html" or ".htm" extension 

    why to learn HTML?

    -> create a website
    -> become a web designer 
    -> master other front-end technologies like javascript,angular, react , vue etc 

    IDE => Microsoft Visual Studio Code => Microsoft , Open Source 

    Online Editors
    Offline Editors 
    IDE => VS Code 

    https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

    how can we execute HTML? 

    With the help of Browsers: Google Chrome, IE(edge) , Mozilla , Opera 

    https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_examples.asp
    https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp

    Change/Add the default styles using CSS => Cascading Style Sheets

   font-size, width , color 

   Background Color, Border, Margins , Padding 
 
   <html> <head> </head><body>

   https://www.w3schools.com/Css/
   https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_quiz.asp 

   Assignment 1 => Profiler Page 

   how can we make the web pages dynamic?

   we have a scripting language called javascript used to convert static content to dynamic content 

   =========================================================================================================

  Javascript is a programming scripting language which we can use to develop any type of web application
    Web Development  . Client Side scripting language

    Script => which executes in browser (function / program which gives output ) 

    LiveScript => initial version

      Java programming language was becoming popular 

    JavaScript => renamed as javascript 

   
    1. Editors / Notepad++ IDE 
        Sublime Text 
        Atom
        Brackets
        webstorm 
        VS Code(recommended) Auto Save , Live Server Extension

    2. Each and every browser will have its own javascript engine 

       Ways to write javascript code 
      1. <script></script>
      2. External file and then include that as path of the script tag  


    3. remove the overhead of saving the file using Auto Save option in VS Code

    4. remove the overhead of refreshing the browser by using live-server option

    
    which is the best place to put javascript code?
     => in body placing the javascript code

    Javascript Variables and data types 
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Variable is a named storage for data 

    Variables are used to store the information 

    Rules to follow while making use of variables 

    1. Variable name should contain only letter,digits,symbols($) and (_)underscore 
    2. First character must not be the digits 
    3. Variable Names should be in camelCase 

    let firstname;  //valid
    let FIrstname;  //valid
    let firstNAME;  //valid
    let first_name: //valid 

    let firstName; // camelCase is always preferred 

    Declaring the Variable 
   
    let message ; //declaration 
    message = "Javascript" // initialization 

    let message = "Javascript" 

    let user = "kumar", age=32, message="Javascript" ; //100% valid 

    let user = "Kumar";
    let age = 32;
    let message = "Javascript"
   
    let $ = 3; // valid
    let my_name ; // valid
    let _ = 2; // valid
    let 1a=4; // invalid violating Rule No 2

   4. Variable Names are Case Sensitive

      let apple;   // both are not same in javascript 
      let aPple;

   5. Should not use keywords/reserved words 

      let let=10; // error 
      https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp

     Exercise : 
         Assignment1
  
		  /*
		Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), 
		which is calculated using the formula: 
		BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
		1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
		2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement
		both versions)
		3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information
		about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
		TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg
		and is 1.95 m tall.
		TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall.
		John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
		GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
		*/ 
		
		Data Types
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
		let message = "Javascript"; // string 
		    message = 10 ;
		
		Javascript is a dynamically typed language 
		
		10+10 = 20
		10+"10" = "1010"
		
		1. Number type
		   let n = 123 ;
		   let m = 123.45;
		    typeof n => number , typeof m => number
			typeof typeof n => string 
			
	    2. BigInt
		   2^53-1 and -(2^53-1) this is a range bound 
		   limitations of number 
		   let n = 78654341234724313465564545n;
		
		3.string 
		  let a = "hello";
		  let b = 'hello';
		  let c = `hello`; //template string literal 
		  
		4. Boolean 
		true or false
		if(10>1){ }
		
		5. undefined 
		   In javascript you declare a variable and not assign any value then it will 
		   hold undefined it.
		   let a;
		   console.log(a);
		   
		6. null 
		   let a = null;
		   in javascript null means "reference to non existing object "
		   typeof a => object 
		   
		   let a = 10;
		    a = "string " 
			let a ;
			 a = null;  a = {} ;
			 
			 a=null;  // clearing
			 
			 a= 20; //assigning
			 
			 a = "string";
			 
			 a= ""; // re-assigning 
			 
			 a=null; // clearing

	       Data type used to store single value are known as Primitive data types 
		   Data types are used to store multiple values are known as Non Primitive Data types
	 
	      Object, Arrays
		  
		  Objects => Collection of various data types (stores the data in key value pair)
		  
		 
		    let userObj = {
				name : "savitha",
				age : 28,
				id : 1234
			}
			
			 what are the ways to declare an object?
			 
		 1. let user = new Object(); // object constructor syntax 
         2. let user = {}; // object literal syntax	

            delete operator can be used only to delete property of an object 

            reserved words can be added as key/property to objects as it adds a seperate meaning
